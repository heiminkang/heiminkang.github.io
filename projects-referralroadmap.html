      <p class="intro">
        This thesis investigates how AI can be strategically integrated into the fragmented 
        Dutch mental healthcare referral system to address persistent systemic challenges, including 
        inefficiencies, repeated referral loops, and fragmented coordination. Employing a multi-method, 
        design-led approach, the research identified three core problem themes and developed a three-horizon transformation roadmap.

      </div>

      <p class="section-body">
        The Dutch mental healthcare system is under significant pressure, evidenced by prolonged waiting lists 
        for over 100,000 individuals and experiencing fragmented communication between General Practitioners (GPs) 
        and specialist care (GGZ). Critically, 67 percent of cases exceed the recommended intake timeframe, and 39 
        percent surpass the treatment timeframe, compromising timely access and treatment outcomes. To address these 
        urgent structural issues, this thesis adopted a design-led, visioning-oriented approach to reimagine the referral system.

      </figure>
      
      <p class="section-body">
        The research established that addressing systemic issues requires shifting 
        beyond implementing isolated AI tools toward strategic, system-level approaches focused on multi-stakeholder care coordination. 
        A key early decision was the adoption of the term ‘Persons with Mental Health Challenges (PMCs)’ to reflect a broader and more 
        normalized conceptualization of mental health, encompassing needs beyond strictly clinical diagnoses.

      </div>

      <p class="section-body">
        This project applied a multi-method approach that triangulated desk research with participatory and data-enabled methods 
        to build a system-level understanding of the Dutch mental healthcare system. Combining system mapping, expert interviews, 
        online mental health community analysis (e.g., topic modeling), and AI tool mapping revealed a GP-centred and fragmented structure, where 
        weak integration between clinical and social care leads to cycles of confusion and delay. The findings underscored the 
        need for system-oriented AI integration to enable coordination, continuity, and shared decision-making across care actors.

      </div>

      <p class="section-body">
          The cross-analysis confirmed that structural barriers translate into emotionally taxing cycles of confusion and delay. 
          These recurring patterns were conceptually organized into a system-level understanding that clarified where and how 
          coordination fails. This insight positioned AI as a potential system enabler — supporting continuity, information flow, 
          and shared decision-making across actors in the mental healthcare network.

      <p class="section-body">
        The framework visualizes interdependent problem themes such as ambiguity in care navigation, fragmentation in care transitions, 
        and mismatch between needs and delivery. It served as a conceptual bridge between problem diagnosis and strategic transformation, 
        shaping the foundation for the AI-enabled roadmap that followed.

      </div>

      <p class="section-body">
        The outcome is a strategic, three-horizon roadmap <b>co-created and iteratively refined</b> with stakeholders 
        through an online collaboration platform to operationalize the future vision of an AI-supported Dutch mental healthcare referral system. 
        It outlines a stepwise transformation — 
        <b>Horizon 1:</b> Building the information foundation, 
        <b>Horizon 2:</b> Empowering participation, and 
        <b>Horizon 3:</b> Aligning coordination. 
        Each horizon integrates <b>AI design guidelines</b> that embed ethical and regulatory principles 
        derived from EU frameworks, ensuring responsible and human-centred AI adoption.

      </figure>

      <p class="section-body">
        The roadmap reframes the referral system from a gatekeeping structure into a dynamic network that supports 
        continuous information flow, participatory decision-making, and equitable collaboration between actors. 
        It demonstrates how AI can evolve from assisting simple information tasks (H1) to enabling predictive 
        coordination and shared decision-making (H3), emphasizing AI as an enabler — integrated with other 
        elements of the roadmap to support the transformation of the Dutch mental healthcare referral system 
        toward its future vision, and applied only within the scope that enables human challenges to be addressed.
