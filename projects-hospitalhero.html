      <p class="intro">
        Hospital Hero helps children and parents reduce anxiety before, during, and after hospital visits through storytelling, 
        mini-games, and a question notebook for doctors. Our project focuses on making the app inclusive for children with visual 
        or auditory impairments—improving access without stigma and keeping the experience engaging. We combined literature, journey mapping, 
        expert input (Visio and product experts), and concept iteration to propose tactile (haptic) interactions alongside an inclusive UI so 
        that more children can prepare with confidence and autonomy.

        <h2 class="section-title">Why inclusivity matters for Hospital Hero.</h2>
      </div>

      <p class="section-body">
        Hospital Hero is currently used in several Dutch hospitals to help children prepare for medical procedures 
        through storytelling, mini-games, and interactive guidance. The app effectively reduces stress and makes hospital 
        visits more playful and understandable. However, for children with visual or auditory impairments, many interactions 
        remain highly visual and text-based, making the experience less accessible for those who may need support the most.
      </p>
      </section>  
      <p class="section-body">
        Research shows that children with sensory impairments often experience higher anxiety and less effective care 
        without adapted tools. To explore this gap, we analyzed the existing Hospital Hero app journey across preparation, 
        play, and reflection stages.

      <p class="section-body">
        The mapping revealed heavy reliance on visual and textual content and limited audio or 
        multisensory elements. This analysis established the foundation for redesign — aiming to make Hospital Hero more 
        inclusive and engaging, empowering children with a sense of control, reducing uncertainty, and avoiding 
        stigmatizing add-ons through seamlessly integrated multisensory design.

      </div>

      <p class="section-body">
        Building on the app journey analysis, we applied two complementary methods — solution mapping and expert interviews — 
        to identify design opportunities for a more inclusive and engaging Hospital Hero experience. The solution mapping analyzed 
        existing assistive and inclusive technologies, from tactile products to accessibility-focused digital tools, revealing how 
        multisensory and haptic interactions could enhance accessibility without introducing stigma.

      </figure>
      <p class="section-body">
        In parallel, expert interviews with specialists from Visio and the Hospital Hero co-founder provided practical insights 
        into inclusive interface design, visual accessibility, and the usability of haptic feedback for children. These findings informed the inclusive design opportunities 
        that guided the concept development.

        <h2 class="section-title">Defining design requirements and goal.</h2>
      </div>

    <p class="section-body">
      The research synthesis led to four key <strong>design requirements</strong> that bridge inclusivity and engagement for children with sensory impairments:
      <strong>(1) Sense of control</strong> — enable children to anticipate and influence their experience;
      <strong>(2) Engaging</strong> — maintain playful motivation through multisensory and tactile cues;
      <strong>(3) Stigma-free</strong> — integrate accessibility features naturally rather than as separate add-ons;
      <strong>(4) Informative</strong> — support understanding and reassurance throughout the visit.
      <strong>(5) Improved journey</strong> — enhance the overall care experience by reducing uncertainty and increasing confidence.
    </p>

<p class="section-body">
  Together, these requirements shaped the design goal:
  <em>“Make Hospital Hero more inclusive and engaging by empowering children with a sense of control, reducing uncertainty through stigma-free design, and enhancing the overall healthcare experience.”</em>

        <div class="section-label">Concept Development</div>
        <h2 class="section-title">Developing the concept: tactile interaction and inclusive UI design.</h2>
      </div>

      <p class="section-body">
        Based on the research insights, an <strong>idea mapping</strong> exercise was conducted to evaluate multiple concept directions 
        along two axes — <em>Inclusivity</em> (how well each concept addresses sensory impairments) and <em>Engagement</em> 
        (how fun and anxiety-reducing the experience is for children). 
        This process positioned <strong>Tactile Interaction in the Hospital Journey</strong> as the <em>primary concept</em> and 
        <strong>Inclusive UI Design</strong> as the <em>sub-concept</em>, combining high inclusivity and high engagement.
      </p>

        <figcaption class="section-caption">  Idea mapping comparing concept directions along <em>Inclusivity</em> (x-axis) and <em>Engagement</em> (y-axis). 
          The mapping identified <strong>Tactile Interaction in the Hospital Journey</strong> as the primary concept 
          and <strong>Inclusive UI Design</strong> as the sub-concept.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p class="section-body">
        The <strong>primary concept</strong> explores how <em>tactile (haptic) feedback</em> can enhance accessibility and emotional engagement during hospital visits, 
        while the <strong>sub-concept</strong> focuses on <em>Inclusive UI Design</em> that ensures visual clarity and personalization.

      <p class="section-body">
        The outcome is a strategic, three-horizon roadmap <b>co-created and iteratively refined</b> with stakeholders 
        through an online collaboration platform to operationalize the future vision of an AI-supported Dutch mental healthcare referral system. 
        It outlines a stepwise transformation — 
        <b>Horizon 1:</b> Building the information foundation, 
        <b>Horizon 2:</b> Empowering participation, and 
        <b>Horizon 3:</b> Aligning coordination. 
        Each horizon integrates <b>AI design guidelines</b> that embed ethical and regulatory principles 
        derived from EU frameworks, ensuring responsible and human-centred AI adoption.

        <figcaption class="section-caption"> Co-created roadmap linking strategic horizons with embedded ethical and regulatory AI design principles.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p class="section-body">
        The roadmap reframes the referral system from a gatekeeping structure into a dynamic network that supports 
        continuous information flow, participatory decision-making, and equitable collaboration between actors. 
        It demonstrates how AI can evolve from assisting simple information tasks (H1) to enabling predictive 
        coordination and shared decision-making (H3), emphasizing AI as an enabler — integrated with other 
        elements of the roadmap to support the transformation of the Dutch mental healthcare referral system 
        toward its future vision, and applied only within the scope that enables human challenges to be addressed.
