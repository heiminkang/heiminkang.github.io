      <p class="intro">
        Hospital Hero helps children and parents reduce anxiety before, during, and after hospital visits through storytelling, 
        mini-games, and a question notebook for doctors. Our project focuses on making the app inclusive for children with visual 
        or auditory impairments—improving access without stigma and keeping the experience engaging. We combined literature, journey mapping, 
        expert input (Visio and product experts), and concept iteration to propose tactile (haptic) interactions alongside an inclusive UI so 
        that more children can prepare with confidence and autonomy.

      </div>

      <p class="section-body">
        Hospital Hero is currently used in several Dutch hospitals to help children prepare for medical procedures 
        through storytelling, mini-games, and interactive guidance. The app effectively reduces stress and makes hospital 
        visits more playful and understandable. However, for children with visual or auditory impairments, many interactions 
        remain highly visual and text-based, making the experience less accessible for those who may need support the most.
      </p>
      </section>  
      <p class="section-body">
        Research shows that children with sensory impairments often experience higher anxiety and less effective care 
        without adapted tools. To explore this gap, we analyzed the existing Hospital Hero app journey across preparation, 
        play, and reflection stages.

      <p class="section-body">
        The mapping revealed heavy reliance on visual and textual content and limited audio or 
        multisensory elements. This analysis established the foundation for redesign — aiming to make Hospital Hero more 
        inclusive and engaging, empowering children with a sense of control, reducing uncertainty, and avoiding 
        stigmatizing add-ons through seamlessly integrated multisensory design.

      <p class="section-body">
        This project applied a multi-method approach that triangulated desk research with participatory and data-enabled methods 
        to build a system-level understanding of the Dutch mental healthcare system. Combining system mapping, expert interviews, 
        online mental health community analysis (e.g., topic modeling), and AI tool mapping revealed a GP-centred and fragmented structure, where 
        weak integration between clinical and social care leads to cycles of confusion and delay. The findings underscored the 
        need for system-oriented AI integration to enable coordination, continuity, and shared decision-making across care actors.

      <p class="section-body">
          The cross-analysis confirmed that structural barriers translate into emotionally taxing cycles of confusion and delay. 
          These recurring patterns were conceptually organized into a system-level understanding that clarified where and how 
          coordination fails. This insight positioned AI as a potential system enabler — supporting continuity, information flow, 
          and shared decision-making across actors in the mental healthcare network.

      <p class="section-body">
        The framework visualizes interdependent problem themes such as ambiguity in care navigation, fragmentation in care transitions, 
        and mismatch between needs and delivery. It served as a conceptual bridge between problem diagnosis and strategic transformation, 
        shaping the foundation for the AI-enabled roadmap that followed.

      <p class="section-body">
        The outcome is a strategic, three-horizon roadmap <b>co-created and iteratively refined</b> with stakeholders 
        through an online collaboration platform to operationalize the future vision of an AI-supported Dutch mental healthcare referral system. 
        It outlines a stepwise transformation — 
        <b>Horizon 1:</b> Building the information foundation, 
        <b>Horizon 2:</b> Empowering participation, and 
        <b>Horizon 3:</b> Aligning coordination. 
        Each horizon integrates <b>AI design guidelines</b> that embed ethical and regulatory principles 
        derived from EU frameworks, ensuring responsible and human-centred AI adoption.

      <p class="section-body">
        The roadmap reframes the referral system from a gatekeeping structure into a dynamic network that supports 
        continuous information flow, participatory decision-making, and equitable collaboration between actors. 
        It demonstrates how AI can evolve from assisting simple information tasks (H1) to enabling predictive 
        coordination and shared decision-making (H3), emphasizing AI as an enabler — integrated with other 
        elements of the roadmap to support the transformation of the Dutch mental healthcare referral system 
        toward its future vision, and applied only within the scope that enables human challenges to be addressed.
